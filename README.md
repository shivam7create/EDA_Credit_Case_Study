Introduction :  This case study aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study,we will develop abasic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.


Business Understanding :  The case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
